    <h1>Yahoo! UI Library: <?php echo $component;?></h1>

<p>The YUI Loader Utility is a client-side JavaScript component that allows you to load specific YUI components and their dependencies into your page via script.  YUI Loader can operate as a holistic solution by loading all of your necessary YUI components, or it can be used to add one or more components to a page on which some YUI content already exists.</p>

<p>YUI Loader adds value in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Reliable, sorted loading of dependencies:</strong> YUI comprises more than two-dozen components, many of which work together to provide the best possible compromise between compartmentalization and code reuse. Because of this, YUI components often need to load with specific dependencies in a specific order. YUI Loader understands which components depend on one another, and based on this knowledge it ensures that the right resources are loaded in the right order.</li>
  <li><strong>Safe, efficient mechanism for adding new components to a page on which YUI may already be present.</strong> Often as developers we write modules that can live in many contexts. In writing a module, we may need to support a variety of scenarios — the module may be introduced into a page on which all of its YUI dependencies are already present, a page on which some but not all are present, or a page on which no YUI content exists at all. YUI Loader looks at the environment as it exists on the page and pulls in only the additional files your module needs to function.</li>
  <li><strong>Automatic use of rolled-up files.</strong> YUI Loader knows about all of the built-in rollup files that ship with YUI — like the yahoo-dom-event.js file that contains the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yahoo/">Yahoo Global Object</a>, the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dom/">Dom Collection</a>, and the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/event/">Event Utility</a>, three components that are commonly used together. By automatically using rolled-up files when it makes sense to do so, the YUI Loader helps you <a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/11/28/performance-research-part-1/">reduce HTTP requests</a> and thereby keep your page as efficient as possible.</li>
</ol>

<p>As you think about how you want to load YUI on the page, you may find it useful to refer to this overview of some of the most common loading strategies and their relative merits:</p>
<ul>
      <li>"<a href="http://yuiblog.com/blog/2008/10/17/loading-yui/">Loading YUI: Seeds, Core, and Combo-handling</a>", by Eric Miraglia on <a href="http://yuiblog.com/">YUIBlog</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>It's important to emphasize that any client-side loading utility is expected to be somewhat less performant than solutions that write <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements directly to the page. The use of dynamic <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> nodes provides good performance and a useful mechanism for bringing in additional JavaScript or CSS after the page has loaded, but for optimal performance you may still wish to write CSS <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> elements to the head of the page and JavaScript <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> elements to the bottom of the page during its initial load.</p>

  <h2 class="first" id="start">Getting Started</h2>
  
<p>To use the YUI Loader Utility, insert its script file into the page.  Note that, unlike all other YUI components, the YUI Loader Utility does <em>not</em> require that the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yahoo/">Yahoo Global Object</a> be present on the page prior to loading &mdash; in fact, the YUI Loader Utility <em>includes</em> the Yahoo Global Object (so you should not load both packages on the same page).  The YUI Loader Utility also includes the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/get/">YUI Get Utility</a>; again, if you are using YUI Loader you should not load Get separately.</p>
    
  <pre><textarea name="code" class="HTML" cols="60" rows="1">
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="http://yui.yahooapis.com/<?php echo($yuiCurrentVersion);?>/build/yuiloader/yuiloader-min.js" &gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</textarea></pre>
<?php
include "../inc/include-notice.inc";
?>

<h2 id="using">Simple Use Case: Adding YUI Components to the Page with the <code>insert()</code> Method</h2>

<p>YUI Loader makes it a simple thing to get started using YUI components. Place the YUI Loader script on the page, tell it what you want to load, and let it sort out all of the dependencies on your behalf: </p>

<textarea name="code" class="JScript" cols="60" rows="1"><!-- Load the YUI Loader script: -->
<script src="http://yui.yahooapis.com/<?php echo $yuiCurrentVersion; ?>/build/yuiloader/yuiloader-min.js"></script>

<script>
// Instantiate and configure Loader:
var loader = new YAHOO.util.YUILoader({

    // Identify the components you want to load.  Loader will automatically identify
    // any additional dependencies required for the specified components.
    require: ["colorpicker", "treeview"],

    // Configure loader to pull in optional dependencies.  For example, animation
    // is an optional dependency for slider.
    loadOptional: true,

    // The function to call when all script/css resources have been loaded
    onSuccess: function() {
        //this is your callback function; you can use
        //this space to call all of your instantiation
        //logic for the components you just loaded.
    },

    // Configure the Get utility to timeout after 10 seconds for any given node insert
    timeout: 10000,

    // Combine YUI files into a single request (per file type) by using the Yahoo! CDN combo service.
    combine: true
});

// Load the files using the insert() method. The insert method takes an optional
// configuration object, and in this case we have configured everything in
// the constructor, so we don't need to pass anything to insert().
loader.insert();

</script></textarea>

<p>In the example above, the YUI Loader script will load from Yahoo servers, calculate the full merged dependency list for the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/colorpicker/">Color Picker</a> and <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/treeview/">TreeView</a> Controls, load the dependencies on the page by inserting dynamic <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> nodes, and then execute your callback logic (in which you can make use of Color Picker and TreeView).</p>

<h2 id="sandbox">Load a Private Copy of YUI with the <code>sandbox()</code> Method</h2>

<p>
Different versions of the same library can sometimes conflict with each other.  When you insert YUI onto a page that may have another
version of the library on it already, it is sometimes preferable to use a privately-scoped copy of YUI
rather than sharing it globally with the entire page.  YUI Loader's <code>sandbox</code> method provides a way to
do this.
</p>

<p><code>sandbox()</code> uses the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/">YUI Connection Manager</a> to fetch the script source, evaluates
it inside of an anonymous function, and returns a reference to a well-known local variable that
can be used without risk of having it overwritten by other code on the page.  The code that is
evaluated looks like this:</p>

<textarea name="code" class="JScript" cols="60" rows="1">(function() {

    var YAHOO = [YUI library source];

    return YAHOO;

})();</textarea>

<p>Setting up a sandbox:</p>

<textarea name="code" class="JScript" cols="60" rows="1"><!-- Load the YUI Loader script: -->
<script src="http://yui.yahooapis.com/<?php echo $yuiCurrentVersion; ?>/build/yuiloader/yuiloader-min.js"></script>
<script>
var loader = new YAHOO.util.YUILoader();
loader.sandbox({
    require: ["treeview"], // what to load
    base: '../../build/', // where on my local domain the library lives
    loadOptional: true, // pull in optional components

    // Executed once the sandbox is successfully created
    onSuccess: function(o) {
        // o.reference is our sandboxed YAHOO object
        var ref = o.reference;
        YAHOO.log("new ref is equal to YAHOO? " + (ref === YAHOO)); // false

        // TreeView can now be used.  Note that YAHOO.widget.TreeView does
        // *not* exist, because it was included only on the sandboxed YAHOO
        // object.
        ref.util.Event.onAvailable("treediv", function() {
                var tree = new ref.widget.TreeView("treediv");
                var n = new ref.widget.TextNode("node 1", tree.getRoot());
                new ref.widget.TextNode("node 2", n);
                new ref.widget.TextNode("node 3", n);
                tree.draw();
            });
    }, 

    // Each time a resource is retrieved, onProgress will be executed
    onProgress: function(o) {
        log("progress:" + o.name);
    },

    // Executed if the the utility failed to create the sandbox
    onFailure: function(msg, xhrobj) {
        var m = "LOAD FAILED: " + msg;
        // if the failure was from the Connection Manager, the object
        // returned by that utility will be provided.
        if (xhrobj) {
            m += ", " + YAHOO.lang.dump(xhrobj);
        }
        YAHOO.log(m);
    },

    // varName: "YAHOO", // What reference should be returned? YAHOO is the default

    // filter: 'debug' // load the debug version of the library
});
</script></textarea>

<p>This feature can be used with other JavaScript libraries as long as they conform to a pattern
   similiar to YUI's in which all functionality resides within a variable <em>that is not forced into the global namespace</em> (e.g.,
   uses <code>var LIBRARY</code> instead of <code>LIBRARY</code> or <code>window.LIBRARY</code>).  To sandbox something other
   than YUI, use the <code>varName</code> config to specify the reference that should be returned to the
   <code>onSuccess</code> handler.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> since the <code>sandbox</code> method uses <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/">Connection Manager</a> to fetch the script source, it is limited
by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy">"same origin" domain restrictions</a> common to all XHR connections.  To use the sandbox feature, you will
need to serve the YUI files from the domain of the page that will use the sandbox or set up
a proxy on the local domain to fetch the remote resource.</p>

<h2 id="config">Configuration Options</h2>

<p>The following configuration options are supported by the YUI Loader Utility.
These can be set in the YUI Loader constructor, set individually on a YUI
Loader instance, or provided to <code>insert()</code>, <code>calculate()</code>
or <code>sandbox()</code>:</p>

<h2 id="usingskins">Using Skins with YUI Loader</h2>

<p>YUI as of version 2.3.0 moved to a skinning model for controlling the presentation of UI controls.  With that release, a default skin, <code>sam</code>, was introduced.  By default, YUI Loader will bring in the <code>sam</code> assets for any YUI component you require for which a skin exists.</p>

<p>As we go forward, the YUI ecosystem will grow to support a number of different skins for various components.  As this occurs, you'll want to be able to specify which skin you wish to use for a given component.  YUI Loader allows you to specify both a global default skin (which defaults to <code>sam</code> unless you specify otherwise) and one or more alternative skins for each component you require.  You control this using the <code>skin</code> property of your Loader instance.</p>

<p>Returning to our simple use case, here's how we might configure TreeView to use an alternative skin, <code>myTVSkin</code>, and Color Picker to use a skin called <code>myCPSkin</code>.</p>

<textarea name="code" class="JScript" cols="60" rows="1">
<script src="http://yui.yahooapis.com/<?php echo($yuiCurrentVersion);?>/build/yuiloader/yuiloader-min.js"></script>

    //Set your skins member here:
    skin: {
        // The default skin, which is automatically applied if not
        // overriden by a component-specific skin definition.
        // Change this in to apply a different skin globally 
        defaultSkin: 'sam',

        // Any component-specific overrides can be specified here,
        // making it possible to load different skins for different
        // components. It is possible to load more than one skin
        // for a given component as well.
        overrides: { 
            colorpicker: ['myCPSkin'],
            treeview: ['myTVSkin']
        }
    },

    }
});

<h2 id="addmodule">Using <code>addModule</code> to Add Non-YUI Content with YUI Loader</h2>

<p>YUI Loader knows all YUI components and their required and optional dependencies.  When you build applications on top of YUI, you can tell YUI Loader about your own custom components and their dependencies as well using YUI Loader's <code>addModule</code> method.</p>

<p><code>addModule</code> is called from a YUI Loader instance and takes as its argument a configuration object that defines the metadata associated with the module you are adding.  The configuration object's members include:</p>

<div class="apisummary">

			<td>fullpath (string)</td>
			<td>Overrides path if path is defined and is used as a full URI to the component's source file (e.g. "http://www.json.org/json.js").</td>

<p>


When loading external scripts that you do not control, specify a <code>varName</code> property.  YUI Loader will determine when the script is fully loaded by polling for this property.  This is only needed in order to support external scripts in Safari 2.x.  All other <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/">A-Grade browsers</a> will work correctly without specifying a <code>varName</code>.
See the <a href="../examples/yuiloader/yl-addmodule.html"><code>addModule</code> example</a> and its accompanying tutorial for more information about using <code>varName</code> properties.</p>

<p>When you <em>do</em> control the the content, and when that content is meant to be used with YUI, the best way to notify YUI Loader that loading is complete is to use the <code>YAHOO.register</code> method.  <code>YAHOO.register</code> is the same method that YUI components use to register themselves with the <code>YAHOO</code> object and record information about themselves in the <code>YAHOO.env</code> registry.</p>

<p><code>YAHOO.register</code> takes three arguments:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>module name</strong>: (string) must be unique, not duplicating any <a href="#modulenames">YUI module names</a> or any other custom module names you may have used;</li>
  <li><strong>core class or object</strong>: a reference to the core class for this component (e.g., <code>YAHOO.util.Anim</code> would be the core class for the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/animation/">Animation Utility</a>);</li>
  <li><strong>environment object</strong>: (object) an object containing a version member and a build member indicating the current version and build information for the component.  </li>
</ol>

<p>For example, the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/animation/">Animation Utility</a> in version 2.2.2 registered itself with the following code:</p>

<textarea name="code" class="JScript" cols="60" rows="1">YAHOO.register("animation", YAHOO.util.Anim, {version: "2.2.2", build: "204"});</textarea>

<p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Use of <code>YAHOO.register</code> obviates the need for a <code>varName</code> property when loading external scripts.</p>

<h2 id="overrideskins">Overriding skins</h2>
<p>In version 2.4.1 of the YUILoader, defining modules that override existing YUI
skins requires that you load them in two phases: 1) The YUI component, 2) The custom component:</p>

<textarea name="code" class="JScript" cols="60" rows="1">// first load treeview
new YAHOO.util.YUILoader({
    require: ['treeview'],
    onSuccess: function() {
        // when treeview is finished loading, define and load the custom tree modules
        var loader = new YAHOO.util.YUILoader();
        // define the css module that overrides the default treeview css
        loader.addModule({
          name:'customtreecss',
          type:'css',
          fullpath:'http://domain/customtree.css',
          requires:['treeview']
        }); 
        // define the script module that extends treeview
        loader.addModule({
          name:'customtree',
          type:'js',
          fullpath:'http://domain/customtree.js',
          // make the css file a requirement for the script
          requires:['customtreecss']
        }); 
        loader.onSuccess = function() {
            // build the custom tree
        };
        loader.insert();
    }
}).insert(); // insert the treeview component immediately
});</textarea>

<h2 id="modulenames">YUI Module Names</h2>

<p>Each YUI component has a corresponding module name that is used as a unique identifier within YUI scripts.  For example, the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/event/">Event Utility</a> is internally referred to as <code>"event"</code>.  YUI Loader loads components based on these unique module names.  Here is the full list of YUI module names.  All except YUI Loader itself can be loaded via the Loader component.</p>

<div class="apisummary">
<?php
include "../inc/moduleNames.inc";
echo $moduleNamesTable;
?>
</div>

<p>YUI ships with some aggregate or "rollup" files, each comprising two or more modules, to help you reduce the number of HTTP requests you make while loading YUI content.  Each aggregate file has its own module name.</p>

<p>Moreover, some modules provide the functionality of one or more modules in the above list &mdash; for example, YUI Loader includes the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/get/">Get Utility</a>.</p>

<p>When you choose to <code><a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/docs/YAHOO.util.YUILoader.html#property_allowRollup">allowRollup</a></code>s, YUI Loader will choose the most appropriate set of files to meet your requirements while using the smallest number of included files. You can also specify an aggregate file directly as a requirement by requesting it by its own module name.  The following is a list of modules that aggregate or include multiple modules:</p>

<div class="apisummary">
<?php
echo $rollupNamesTable;
?>
</div>


<h2 id="migrating">Migrating from 2.3.x to 2.4+</h2>

<p>YUI Loader's API changed, and its implementation simplified in the 2.4.0 release.  2.3.x implementations
that use <code>YAHOO.util.YUILoader</code> instances will require changing the <code>onLoadComplete</code> property
to <code>onSuccess</code>.  <code>YAHOO_config</code> is no longer supported for loading YUI components.  Implementations
that used <code>YAHOO_config</code> will need to be reworked to use a <code>YAHOO.util.YUILoader</code> instance.</p>
<p>The <code>verifier</code> function is no longer supported for loading external scripts.  Instead you must specify a <code>varName</code> property to support Safari 2.x when the script doesn't use YUI's register functionality.

<p>If you are attempting to implement a version of YUI Loader earlier than 2.4.0, refer to the
API documentation and examples in the distribution for that release.  Older releases are archived
on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=165715">SourceForge</a>.

<h2 id="knownissues">Known Issues</h2>

<p>Unlike other properties, the filter property can't be set directly on an instance.  It must 
be set by passing a configuration object to either the YUILoader constructor or the 
insert/sandbox method.</p>

<p>In 2.4.1 Defining custom modules that override existing YUI skins requires a specific syntax.  See
the <a href="#overrideskins">addModule</a> section for details.</p>

<?php include "../inc/mobileSection.inc";?>  
<p>The YUI Loader is fully supported on Apple's iPhone and the Nokia N-Series browsers; you can expect it to perform identically on those browsers relative to the supported <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/">A-Grade browsers</a>.</p>
