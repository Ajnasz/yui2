The Button ARIA Plugin makes it easy to use the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">WAI-ARIA Roles and States</a> with the Button
and ButtonGroup controls.
Using the ARIA plugin, Buttons are more interoperable with assistive technologies (AT),
such as screen readers, making them more accessible to users with disabilities.
