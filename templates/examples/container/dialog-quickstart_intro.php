<p>The Dialog Control is designed to allow you to retrieve information from the user and make use of that information within the page &mdash; whether interally to the page or by sending the information to the server via form post or XMLHttpRequest.  This example shows how to do the latter.  Click the button to show the Dialog instance and its form fields; fill out the form; submit the form.  Dialog will automatically use the YUI Connection Manager to send the data via XMLHttpRequest to the server and will then echo that data back to you on the page.</p>
