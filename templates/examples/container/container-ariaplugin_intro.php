The Container ARIA Plugin makes it easy to use the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/">WAI-ARIA Roles and States</a> with the Container
family of controls.
Using the ARIA plugin, Dialogs, Alerts and Tooltips created using the Container family are 
more interoperable with assistive technologies (AT), such as screen readers, making them more 
accessible to users with disabilities.
