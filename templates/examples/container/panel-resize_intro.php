<p>Operating systems offer windows that can be resized, often by dragging from the lower right-hand corner (and, on Microsoft Windows, from the window edges). This example implements resizability for the Panel control, by leveraging YAHOO.util.Resize to introduce a resize handle to the bottom-right corner of the footer. Resize events are listened for, and the height configuration property of the Panel is set to reflect the new height of Panel's containing element.</p>
