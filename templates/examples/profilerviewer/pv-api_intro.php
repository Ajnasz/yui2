<p>In this example, we explore the use of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/profilerviewer/">ProfilerViewer</a> API to customize the console slightly while taking a thorough look at the performance profile of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/menu/">YUI Menu Control</a>. Customizations include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The console launcher is reduced in size; </li>
  <li>The console is draggable via the header;</li>
  <li>The height of the table and the number of functions profiled in the chart are increased;</li>
  <li>A filter is used to show only functions that have been called at least once.</li>
</ol>
