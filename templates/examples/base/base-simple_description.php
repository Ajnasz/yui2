<h2 class="first">About This Example</h2>

<p>YUI Reset neutralizes the browser-provided presentation of HTML elements. But a default presentation is often convenient, so YUI Base provides one that is consistent across browsers and operating systems. This example is a test page showing HTML elements with YUI Reset, YUI Fonts, and YUI Base applied.</p>

<p>Because CSS examples are susceptible to other CSS on the page, this example is only available in a new window at the above link.</p>
