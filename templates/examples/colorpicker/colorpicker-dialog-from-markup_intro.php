<p>This example differs from <a href="colorpicker-dialog-from-script.html">the previous example</a> only in that the markup for the Color Picker instance is placed on the page rather than being generated automatically by the control.  By exploring this markup and the CSS file accompanying Color Picker <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/download/">in the YUI download</a>, you will get a sense of how to create your own customized interface for Color Picker that reflects the design imperatives of your own implementation.</p>

<p>To interact with this example, click the "Show Color Picker" button below.  You can then experiment with enabling/disabling portions of the picker interface via the dashboard and submit color data via <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/">Connection Manager</a> and peruse the returned values that are echoed back to the page.</p>
