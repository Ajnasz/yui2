<p>The Color Picker below looks much like the pickers in other examples.  However, two changes have been made:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Element IDs have been customized:</strong> Color Picker uses a default set of element IDs when it creates the DOM for your picker instance. If you want to control those IDs, you may need to change these defaults.  (In addition to the method described here, you can also pass in new IDs via the constructor; see the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/colorpicker/#customIds">Customizing Element IDs section of the Color Picker User's Guide</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Form labels have been customized:</strong> Instead of R, G, and B, we're using here the strings &quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;, and &quot;Blue&quot;. This illustrates the technique you might use to translate your Color Picker interface into multiple languages. </li>
</ol>
