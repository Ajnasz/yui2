<p>This example explores the implementation of a Color Picker Control within the context of a popup <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/container/dialog/">Dialog</a>.  The control can be called up in the floating Dialog, a color can be chosen, and upon submission of the Color Picker's value the color data is submitted to the server using Dialog's built-in support for <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/">Connection Manager</a>.</p>

<p>Click the "Show Color Picker" button to get started.  Use the other buttons on the configuration dashboard to explore different configurations of the Color Picker Controls.  When you submit your color choice, the example uses Connection Manager to echo back <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/colorpicker/#formdata">the form fields that were passed to the server</a>.</p>
