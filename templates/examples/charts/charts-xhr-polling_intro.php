<p>The <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/charts/">YUI Charts Control</a> provides built-in support for iterative polling for data over XHR using an XHR <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datasource/">DataSource</a> instance.  In the example below, iterative polling causes the chart to refresh every several seconds and animate its display to represent the new data.</p>
<p>Please note: The YUI Charts Control requires Flash Player 9.0.45 or higher. The latest version of Flash Player is available at the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer">Adobe Flash Player Download Center</a>.</p>
