<p>In this example, we will add pagination to an ordered list.  Some things to note:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Pagination controls are added in a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> as well as in a <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>.</li>
    <li>All included pagination controls use inline elements, so the containers needn't be block elements.</li>
    <li>A custom skin treatment has been applied.</li>
    <li>State changes made to the Paginator propagate to all controls in all containers.</li>
</ul>
