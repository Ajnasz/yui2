<p>Event delegation is a technique whereby you use a single event handler on a parent element to listen for interactions that affect the parent's descendant elements; because events on the descendant elements will bubble up to the parent, this can be a reliable and extremely efficient mitigation strategy for reducing the number of resource-consuming event handlers you have on any given page.

<p>In the example below, mousing over or clicking on the list items will report their ID attributes in the Logger window on the right side of the screen.  Because we're using event delegation, only one event listener is needed for each type of event (<code>click</code> and <code>mouseover</code>) to handle the event response for <code>n</code> list items.  Even if there were 100 list items, we'd still just need one event handler per event type.</p>
