<p>Clicking in the grey box resizes the blue <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> within it. We consider this an "interesting moment" in our script, so we create a <a href="/yui/event/#customevent">Custom Event</a> called <code>onSizeChange</code> that fires whenever the blue box is resized. This Custom Event, when fired, publishes the blue box's new size. <strong>Note:</strong> <code>onSizeChange</code> isn't a DOM event &mdash; it's an arbitrary "custom" event that has meaning in the context of our script, and an event that we think other scripts on the page might be interested in knowing about.</p>

<p>One subscriber to our <code>onSizeChange</code> Custom Event looks at the new width and resizes the brown box to match. A second subscriber looks at the blue <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>'s new height and resizes the red box to match. </p>
