<p>In some cases, you may wish to use YUI Loader to bring additional components into a page that already contains some YUI content.  In this example, we'll look at how to use YUI Loader to augment a page's existing YUI content by bringing in additional dependencies for a new component.</p>

<p>The current page &mdash; the YUI examples template &mdash; uses several YUI components: The <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/logger/">Logger Control</a> to power the logger console in the upper right corner, the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/button/">Button Control</a> to stylize our "call-to-action" buttons for launching new windows or enabling the Logger, and so on.   When you click the button in the middle of the example canvas below, YUI Loader will be used to fetch an additional component, the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/tabview/">TabView Control</a>, and construct a tabset in the example canvas.  Watch the logger console at right to see the event flow as you push the button.</p>
