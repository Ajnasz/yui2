<a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/">Connection Manager</a> exposes <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/event/#customevent">Custom Events</a> that track the progress of a transaction throughout its lifecycle.  These Custom Events are raised at the global level and at the transaction level.  The following code example provides a step-by-step approach to subscribing to transactional Custom Events raised by Connection Manager.  In this scenario, an event handler object is created to handle all of the Custom Events; this event handler object is passed to Connection Manager in the callback object.  Connection Manager will automatically subscribe to the events and fire the specified events.
