<p>This example shows how to use advanced test options, which allow you to specify additional information about how a test should be run.
  Each <a href="/yui/yuitest/#testcase"><code>TestCase</code></a> can specify up to three different options for tests,
  including tests that should be ignored, tests that should throw an error, and tests that should fail.</p>
