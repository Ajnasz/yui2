<p>This example shows how to create an asynchronous test with the YUI Test framework for testing browser-based JavaScript code. 
  A <a href="/yui/yuitest/#testcase"><code>TestCase</code></a> object is created with a test that waits for a
  few seconds before continuing. The <a href="/yui/yuitest/#testrunner"><code>TestRunner</code></a>
  is then used to run the tests once the page has loaded.</p>
