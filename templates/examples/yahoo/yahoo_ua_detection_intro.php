<p>This example demonstrates the use of <code>YAHOO.env.ua</code> to identify the user's browser and to branch JavaScript logic based on what browser is being used.  (<strong>Note:</strong> We strongly recommend using feature detection rather than user-agent sniffing to fork code; only use this technique where it is absolutely necessary to do so &mdash; for example, in cases where browsers do not report their own capabilities accurately.)</p>
