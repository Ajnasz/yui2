This example demonstrates how to use the ContextMenu widget to create two
context menus.  There is one for each ewe that is created and one for the green 
field that the ewes graze in.  Use the ewe context menu to rename, 
clone or delete Dolly.  The field's context menu enables the deletion of all 
the ewes from the field, the addition of a new ewe and the ability to 
modify the color of the grass.
