This example demonstrates how to listen for DOM-related events.  Interaction 
with the Menu will result in event information being output to the console.  
<em>Please note</em>: Disabled MenuItem instances do not fire DOM events.  This 
is demonstrated with the MenuItem named "MenuItem 2."

<em>Note:</em> By default clicking outside of a Menu instance will hide it.  
Additionally, MenuItem instances without a submenu or a URL to navigate to will 
hide their parent Menu instance when clicked.  Click the "Show Menu" button 
below to make the Menu instance visible if it is hidden.
