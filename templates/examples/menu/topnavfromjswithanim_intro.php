This example demonstrates how to create a traditional, two-column page layout
(<a href="../../grids/">using Grids</a>) with top navigation featuring 
animated drop-down menus.  The top navigation is created using a MenuBar 
instance that is constructed using existing markup and enables the user to 
navigate to different landing pages for each Yahoo! product category.  If
JavaScript is enabled, submenus are appended to the items in the MenuBar,  
allowing the user to skip the product landing pages and proceed directly to a 
given property.
