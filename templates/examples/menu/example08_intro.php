<p>
This example demonstrates how to create a multi-tiered menu using nothing 
but JavaScript.
</p>
<p id="clicknote">
<em>Note:</em> By default clicking outside of a Menu instance will hide it.  
Additionally, MenuItem instances without a submenu or a URL to navigate to will 
hide their parent Menu instance when clicked.  Click the "Show Menu" button 
below to make the Menu instance visible if it is hidden.
