This example demonstrates how to set MenuItem configuration properties at 
runtime and listen for the changes through the "configChanged" event.

<p id="clicknote">
<em>Note:</em> By default clicking outside of a menu will hide it.  
Additionally, menu items without a submenu or a URL to navigate to will hide their 
parent menu when clicked.  Click the "Show Menu" button below to make the menu 
visible if it is hidden.
