This example demonstrates how to create a traditional, two-column page layout
(<a href="../../grids/">using Grids</a>) with top navigation featuring 
animated drop-down menus.  The top navigation is created using a MenuBar 
instance that is constructed using existing markup and enables the user to 
navigate to different landing pages for each Yahoo! product category.
