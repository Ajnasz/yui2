<p>This example demonstrates a simple horizontal dual-thumb Slider implementation.  Some characteristics to note include the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The thumbs are set on a slide bar with a 200 pixel range.</li>
    <li>A minimum distance is provided, preventing the thumbs from coming within 10 pixels of each other.</li>
    <li>Initial min and max values are supplied as 100 and 130 respectively.</li>
    <li>Clicking on the background will animate the nearest thumb.</li>
    <li>Min and Max value offsets are calculated from the <strong>center</strong> of the thumbs and must be accounted for conversion calculations.</li>
</ul>
