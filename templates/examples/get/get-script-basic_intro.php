<p>This example employs the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/get/">YUI Get Utility</a> in a simple use case: retrieving JSON data from a cross-domain web service. While this is a relatively common usage, it's important to understand the security ramifications of this technique. Scripts loaded via the Get Utility (or any other &quot;script node&quot; solution) execute immediately once they are loaded. If you do not fully control (or fully trust) the script's source, this is not a safe technique and it can put the security of your users' data at risk. (For more information on the dangers of cross-site scripting [XSS] exploits, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting">check out the Wikipedia entry on this subject</a>.)</p>
<p>Here, we will use a trusted Yahoo! Search web service called <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/search/siteexplorer/V1/inlinkData.html">Site Explorer</a> to return a list of inbound links for a given URL. The principal difference between this example and similar examples using <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/">YUI Connection Manager</a> is that this technique does not require a server-side proxy. The browser connects directly to the third-party web service without bouncing through a proxy page as is required when using the XMLHttpRequest object (on which Connection Manager relies).</p>
