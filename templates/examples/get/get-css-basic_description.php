<h2 class="first">Using the Get Utility to Add/Remove CSS Stylesheets:</h2>

<p>In this example, clicking on the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/button/">YUI Buttons</a> at the top of the News module adds or removes a CSS stylesheet.  The stylesheets are added and purged on-demand by the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/get/">YUI Get Utility</a>.  This technique allows you defer the loading of some of your CSS style rules until after the initial page load &nbsp; ideally, you defer their loading until they're needed...and if they're never needed, they never need to load.  There are two performance wins here: Less CSS needs to load up front, which makes the page load more quickly, and there are fewer CSS rules in play which makes the page easier for the browser to render and manipulate.  In practice, you'd never want to implement this technique in a situation as simple as the one described in this example &nbsp; it would be much more efficient, with simple rules, to include everything on the page in the initial load.  But in a more complex application, the deferred loading of some CSS can be helpful. (<strong>Note:</strong> This example also illustrates the use of the Get Utility's <code>purge</code> method for removing CSS link nodes from the page.  While <code>purge</code> causes an immediate repaint in some <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/">A-Grade browsers</a>, others need to be prodded to repaint.  While we've illustrated one way to do this here, the use of <code>purge</code> remove stylesheets on the fly is not a light technique.  Use it with discretion.)</p>

<p>This example has the following dependencies:</p>

<p>We start with a simple form on the page that will post to the <a href="http://news.search.yahoo.com/news/advanced">Yahoo! News Search engine</a>; if JavaScript is not enabled, the user will still be able to use the functionality of the News module.  A placeholder is added for the YUI Buttons that we'll add via script.  Those buttons do not need to be part of the page markup, because they aren't required for the core functionality of the page...they just control the CSS addition and removal, which in this case is cosmetic.</p>

<p>With the markup in place, we can now create our YUI Buttons.  We'll use Buttons of type <code>checkbox</code>; these can be clicked on or off to add/remove their corresponding CSS stylesheets.  The <code>name</code> property of each Button will be used to identify the specific CSS stylesheet that the Button controls.</p>

<textarea name="code" class="JScript" cols="60" rows="1">// YUI Buttons are attractive and effective for "call to action"
// tasks like the one here.  We'll create buttons purely from
// JavaScript; there's no need for this style-change functionality
// to be "accessible"; in fact, it's purely cosmetic, so keeping
// these buttons out of the page's initial DOM is preferable.  We'll
// use the "name" property of the button to determine what CSS to
// load when each button is clicked:
var borderButton = new Button({
    id: "borderButton",
    type: "checkbox",
    name: "border",
    label: "Border CSS",
    container: "buttonContainer" 
});
var backgroundButton = new Button({
    id: "backgroundButton",
    type: "checkbox",
    name: "background",
    label: "Background CSS",
    container: "buttonContainer"
});
var textButton = new Button({
    id: "textButton",
    type: "checkbox",
    name: "text",
    label: "Text CSS",
    container: "buttonContainer"
});</textarea>

<p>The Get Utility is invoked when a Button's <code>checked</code> state changes; this could happen via a click or by tabbing to a Button and pressing <code>return</code> or <code>enter</code>.  When that happens, the Button's <code>onCheckedChange</code> event fires.  At that point, we determine whether the new button state is checked (in which case we bring in the related CSS file) or unchecked (in which case we purge the related CSS file).</p>

<textarea name="code" class="JScript" cols="60" rows="1">// Checkbox buttons are either checked or unchecked; when their state
// changes, their "onCheckedChange" event fires.  We'll use that

    var name = this.get("name");

<p>In the codeblock above, we call the <code>purge</code> method to remove CSS files when Buttons are unchecked.  The <code>purge</code> function is part of <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/get/#args">the callback object</a> passed to the <code>onSuccess</code> or <code>onFailure</code> handler registered with the Get Utilty when the <code>css</code> method is called.  In our <code>onSuccess</code> handler, we will save that callback object in an associative array so we can access <code>purge</code> as needed when a Button is unchecked: </p>
