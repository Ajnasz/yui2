    This example showcases the dynamic loading capabilities of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/carousel/">YUI Carousel Control</a>.  The YUI Carousel Control exposes an event called <code>loadItems</code>.  This
    event is fired whenever the Carousel needs items to be loaded into it for
    display.  Subscribing  to this event makes it easy to dynamically load
    the next set of images.
