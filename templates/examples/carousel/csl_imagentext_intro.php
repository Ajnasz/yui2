<p> This example uses the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/carousel">YUI Carousel Control</a> to showcase an example where each
  (list) item contains an image and some text.  As always, you can use arrow
  keys to select items or to click on an item to select it. </p>
<p> Also in this example, you will see the animation capabilities available in
  the YUI Carousel Control.  For getting an animated effect during scroll, you
  will have to set the <code>animation</code> configuration setting in the constructor and include the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/animation/">YUI Animation Utility</a> on the page.</p>
