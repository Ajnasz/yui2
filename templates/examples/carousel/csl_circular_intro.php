<p> This example showcases a simple circular Carousel.  The <code>isCircular</code> configuration setting can be used to make a Carousel "circular" &mdash; meaning that, once the last item on the Carousel is selected, the "next" item will be the first item. </p>

  on an item to select it.  These are built-in features of the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/carousel/">YUI Carousel Control</a>.</p>
