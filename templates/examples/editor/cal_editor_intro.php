<p>This example adds a button to the Rich Text Editor's Toolbar that displays a <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/calendar/">Calendar Control</a> for choosing dates. It also demonstrates how to manage the state of a custom button.</p>

<p>Click the Date button (<img src="<?php echo $assetsDirectory; ?>calendar_default.gif">) in the Toolbar to display the Calendar Control, then select a date and it will be placed inside the Editor.</p>

<p>You can also click on a date that has been inserted in the Editor and the Date button will enable. When the Date button is enabled and you click it the corresponding date will be selected in the Calendar Control when it is displayed.</p>
