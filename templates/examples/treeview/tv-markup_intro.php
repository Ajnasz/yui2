<p>In this simple example you can see how to build <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/treeview/">TreeView Control</a> instance  from several different sources of data:</p>

<ol>
  <li>an HTML list on the page;</li>
  <li>an existing TreeView instance's definition;</li>
  <li>a  branch of an existing TreeView instance (e.g., from one of its nodes).</li>
</ol>
