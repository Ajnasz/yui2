<p>This example demonstrates label editing and keyboard navigation in the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/treeview/">YUI TreeView Control</a>.  As you interact with the TreeView instance below, you'll find that some nodes allow you to edit them &mdash; double-click on node labels to open the inline editor.  This example also demonstrates how you can use arrow keys, +/- keys (expand/collapse), and the enter key to navigate and control the TreeView instance.</p>
