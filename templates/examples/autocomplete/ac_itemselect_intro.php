<p>This AutoComplete implementation points to a JavaScript array that is available in-memory, allowing for a zippy user interaction without the need for a server-side component. The data consists of an account name, and an account number. The AutoComplete allows the user to search by name, but by subscribing to the itemSelectEvent Custom Event, populates a hidden form field with the ID, which the server would need for processing the hypothetical submission.</p>
