<p>This example is designed to allow you to experiment with the various configuration properties provided by AutoComplete and to explore their impact on the interaction.  The first field after the AutoComplete input textbox is a select element that allows you to test for bleed-through on Internet Explorer when the AutoComplete suggestion container descends to cover it.  The remaining form fields allow you to change property settings on the AutoComplete instance and to see immediately how those changes feel in the browser.</p>
