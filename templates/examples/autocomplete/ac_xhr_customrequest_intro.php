<p>This AutoComplete implementation points to the Yahoo! Search webservice using an XHRDataSource. Since the third-party API requires certain application-specific paramaters to be passed in, the generateRequest() method has been redefined to append these special values. The <code>queryDelay</code> paramater has been increased to account for the large data payload returned by the Yahoo! Search webservice, so as to reduce throttle client-side processing.</p>
