<p>This example demonstrates the CSS applied to an implementation of the DataTable control that uses the "Sam Skin". You can read more about the general approach to skinning YUI components <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/skinning/">in this in-depth article</a>. Change any or all of the skin CSS (but not the core CSS) for a more customized look and feel.</p>

<p>Please note that as of version 2.6.0, all state-related CSS classes, such as "yui-dt-resizeable", "yui-dt-sortable", "yui-dt-first", or "yui-dt-odd" are now assigned directly on TH and TD elements, not on liner DIV elements.</p>
