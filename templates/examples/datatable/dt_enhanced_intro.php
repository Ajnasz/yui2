<p>This example creates a DataTable instance based on markup that already exists
on the page. By progressively enhancing markup with higher order functionality,
users who do not have JavaScript enabled are still able to view the page's content
and experience core functionality.</p>

<p>In this example's code, note that we listen for the window "load" event
before calling our function to be sure that the original table markup is fully
rendered and available as a DataSource source for our DataTable instance.</p>
