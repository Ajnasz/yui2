CSS Grids Release Notes

*** version 0.12 ***

* removed redundant "text-align:left" from nodes below #doc
* removed small-font treatment on #ft
* removed margin-bottom from #hd,#bd
* added two new #doc definitions (#doc2 and #doc3) that provide 
  950px centered and 100% page width presets to supplement the 
  original 750px centered page width.
* made ".first" selectors more precise by binding to divs, to 
  make it less likely that our .first definitions will impact 
  nested content elements wishing to use this nomenclature.
* fixed "nested yui-gc" bug
* fixed build-process whitespace bug with .yui-t2 and .yui-t5
* migrated .yui-t's technique to "negative margins" technique 
  from "floated ems"
* "negative margins" technique caused z-index issues, so 
  position:relative was added to the secondary yui-b to enable correct z-index 
* captured optimization benefits from inheritence wins via code 
  reorganizations

  Was: ".yui-t7  #main .yui-b{min-width:750px;}"
